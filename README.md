## Inspiration

We've seen many users to ask for QR code for UPI payments at campus shops / canteens , the problem in QR code is sometimes it is difficult for customers to scan or find the correct QR code and do payment at shops , so we come accross a solution where our app will provide all the possible payment UPI id's to the customer with an easy to understant User Interaface and details .


## Challenges we ran into

Time Constraint: Time was a very big factor to build our prototype since it is a very big project and to complete it within a limited time frame was a very big factor.
