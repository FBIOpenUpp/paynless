## Inspiration

We have noticed that many customers at campus shops and canteens struggle to scan or locate the correct QR code for making UPI payments. To address this issue, we have come up with a solution where our app provides all possible UPI IDs for payment to the customer, in an easy-to-understand user interface, along with relevant details.

## Challenges we ran into

Time was a major constraint in building our prototype, as it was a large project and completing it within a limited timeframe was a significant challenge.
